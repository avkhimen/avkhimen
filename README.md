- 👋 Hi, I’m @avkhimen. I am a Candian Engineer and Data Scientist.
- 👀 I’m interested in applications of Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and mathematical optimization methods to problems in transmission and distribution systems. I am also actively following developments in economics, finance, and cryptocurrencies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply cutting-edge multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to problems involving continuous action spaces.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solutions to problems in finance, cryptocurrencies, engineering, and social sciences.
- 📫 I can easily be reached at avkhimen@ualberta.ca or vavkhimenia@gmail.com.
